# CodeSphere - Cloud-Based Collaborative Code Editor

CodeSphere is a cloud-based collaborative code editor inspired by VS Code & Replit.  
Write, run, and share code in multiple languages directly from your browser with real-time collaboration, syntax highlighting, and an integrated terminal.  

This project uses **Next.js** for the frontend, **Clerk** for authentication, **Convex** for the database, and is deployable on **Vercel**.
